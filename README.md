### Project Overview

The project involved developing a Chrome extension named "Virtual Study Room" aimed at helping users boost productivity when studying. The extension features a Pomodoro timer with customizable durations, motivational quotes, ambient themes, sound settings, and interactive controls to start, pause, and reset the timer.

### Achievements

- **Pomodoro Timer Functionality**: Successfully implemented the core Pomodoro functionality that includes a countdown timer which the user can start, pause, and reset.
- **Customization Features**:
  - **Timer Duration**: Users can select their preferred session duration from a dropdown menu, instantly updating the timer.
  - **Ambient Themes**: Users can choose from different themes like "Library" and "Caf√©" to enhance their focus.
  - **Ambient Sound**: Users can choose from different sounds like "Cafe" and "Forest" to enhance their focus. Users can mute the sound, too.
  - **Motivational Quotes**: Random motivational quotes are displayed every time the extension is loaded to inspire users.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Converted control buttons to icon-based buttons using Font Awesome for a modern, intuitive user interface.
  - Added functionality to remember user settings across sessions using local storage for themes, sounds, and timer durations.

### Struggles

- **CSS Styling**: Ensuring that the extension's UI remained consistent and functional across different screen sizes and operating systems proved challenging but was ultimately managed through meticulous CSS testing.
- **JavaScript Execution**: Managing multiple `window.onload` events was problematic as they interfered with each other; consolidated these into a single function to streamline execution.

### Future Enhancements

- **Advanced User Settings**: Include options for users to set the number of Pomodoros before a long break and customize the length of breaks.
- **Integration with Task Management**: Allow users to link tasks with Pomodoros, enhancing productivity tools.
- **Cross-Platform Synchronization**: Develop functionality to sync settings and progress across devices via a user account.

### Project Structure

- **`popup.html`**: Contains the HTML structure of the popup displayed when the user clicks the extension icon. It includes input controls for setting the timer, choosing themes/sounds, and viewing quotes.
- **`popup.css`**: Provides styling for the popup.
- **`popup.js`**: Handles all the logic for timer functionality, theme switching, audio control, randomized quotes, and storage of user preferences.
- **`manifest.json`**: Configures a Chrome extension named "Virtual Study Room", providing basic functionality with permissions to access active tabs and set alarms.
